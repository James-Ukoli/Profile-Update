    <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>

        <h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
        <article>
        <p> I always knew that I wanted to dive into the tech world when I first laid eyes
            on robotics in a camp that I did when I was 9 years old. I then transitioned to 
        pursuing a career in health science, but I knew deep down inside my heart that I wanted
    to get into tech and web development. To me, this field was like a MAGIC TRICK that I must learn to create!
During those long years of hard studies, I was able to learn how to work together with teammates, and to also have
a creative mindset to complete a given objective on your own efficiently. </p>

<p> </p>

<p> Ok yeah but I also got to keep myself from going insane right?
     Growing up, I had many hobbies that I enjoyed that helped me become the person I am today:</p>
